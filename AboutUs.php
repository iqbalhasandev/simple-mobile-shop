		When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives, share it. <br>
		The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing<br>
		context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are<br>
		more likely to connect with them and pass them on.People tend to think that "About Us" pages have to<br>
		sound formal to gain credibility and trust. But most people find it easier to trust real human beings,<br>
		rather than a description that sounds like it came from an automaton. Trying to sound too professional<br>
		on your "About Us" page results in stiff, â€œsafeâ€� copy and design -- the perfect way to make sure your <br>
		company blends in with the masses.We know -- no industry jargon. If you think it makes you sound super <br>
		smart on your "About Us" page, think again. People want and appreciate straight talk about what your <br>
		business does. After all, if people can't figure out what you do, how will they know they need your <br>
		product or service?Instead of following the classic "About Us" script and writing a few paragraphs <br>
		about the company's mission and origins, try something different -- there are plenty of ways to make <br>
		it more visually compelling.Yes, this post is about, well, "About Us" pages. But sometimes, you don't<br>
		always need to wait for users to get there in order to make a statement. That's part of breaking the <br>
		mold to showcase your company's personality.Who would you trust more: A company talking about how <br>
		awesome it is, or a colleague raving about the company's work? I'd bet that you prefer the latter <br>
		that colleagueis more likely to be unbiased and give you a realistic understanding of what the company<br>
		is like. Including customer testimonials on your "About Us" page can give prospects and leads a more <br>
		down-to-earth view of your company.
